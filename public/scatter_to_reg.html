                    <p>A scatter plot displays a series of observations on a Cartesian coordinate system where the two
                        dimensions ($x$ and $y$) represent features of our interest. Despite its simplicity, a scatter
                        plot offers valuable insights. At a glance, we can determine the range of values, clusters, and
                        outliers. Often, a likely association between the two features becomes apparent, and maybe we
                        can even imagine a line that models and extends the general trend the scatter plot points out.
                    </p>


                    <p>The visual characteristics of the scatterplot played a crucial role in the development of the
                        regression line. When Sir Francis Galton (in the early 19th century) plotted the heights of
                        parents
                        against the heights of their offspring, he noticed that taller parents tended to have taller
                        children, and shorter parents tended to have shorter children, but the heights of the
                        children
                        tended to move closer to the average height of the population. Galton called this phenomenon
                        "regression towards mediocrity", where extreme values (either tall or short) move closer to

                    <p>Regression is a cornerstone in statistics and a core concept in modern machine learning,
                        whether you're attempting to find a third point by interpolating linearly between two known
                        points
                        or using a complex neural network for prediction, regression is always present in the
                        background.
                        This article will work out the regression line from a two-dimensional scatter plot in an
                        intuitive
                        way. Once we have a firm understanding of this process more advanced concepts will be easier to
                        grasp. </p>

                    <p>In the scatter plot above showing the average height of parents and their children, you might
                        have spotted a trend and a possible line describing the cloud of dots. With a simple trick, we
                        can fabricate a satisfyingly accurate line. Namely, we can group our observations along the
                        $x$-axis, calculate the group averages $\bar y_i$, map them on the cloud, and draw a line
                        through them, voilà, there is our <strong>graph of averages</strong>.

                        The information of the scatter was condensed into a few dots. As shown in the plotted
                        graph, larger groups yield a smoother curve but sacrifice a lot of information. On the other
                        hand,
                        smaller groups
                        preserve more information, making the graph more sensitive to variations in the data.
                        This is
                        commonly referred to as the bias-variance trade-off or generalization versus overfitting
                        problem

                        While the graph of averages may seem like a reasonable summarization of the relationship
                        between the
                        variables, it is essentially just a series of dots connected by a line without any
                        functional
                        expression. To construct a function for this graph, one would have to piece it together,
                        line by
                        line, from dot to dot. If we were to extract an estimate $\hat{y}$ from this
                        hypothetical graph, it
                        would require a linear interpolation along the line of the relevant $x$ segment of that
                        graph, which
                        is not what we're looking for.

                    <p>
                        Another method to summarize the information stored in a scatter plot is by finding the
                        averages of
                        your variables and their standard deviations $s_{x}$ and $s_y$. The two averages mark
                        the <em>point
                            of
                            averages</em> ($\bar{x}, \bar{y}$), which sits in the middle of the cloud of
                        observations. The standard deviation is the most commonly used measure of the spread and is
                        equal to
                        the square
                        root of the variance $s^2$. Often you'll see variance written like this $\sigma^2$ and standard
                        deviation as $\sigma$ which signify population parameters, that describe the whole population.
                        Normally, however,
                        only a sample is available, and measures obtained from samples are called (sample)
                        statistics.
                        Henceforth, I will refer to sample statistics and use their symbols since we usually
                        work with
                        sample data.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The standard deviation of $X$ can be thought of as a “typical” distance of the
                        observations $x_i$
                        from its mean, $\bar{x}$. Like the variance, the standard deviation is always a positive
                        number and
                        penalizes large deviations from the mean by squaring the errors.

                        $$s_{x} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}}$$

                        The point of averages ($\bar{x}, \bar{y}$) and the standard deviations $s_{x}$ and $s_y$
                        help us
                        understand where the middle of all observations lies and what the typical deviation from
                        that point
                        is. By starting from the point of averages, we can draw a line that has a slope of
                        $\frac{s_y}{s_x}$. Each step of one $s_x$ (typical deviation from $\bar{x}$) along the
                        x-axis is
                        then associated with one step of $s_y$ (typical deviation from $\bar{y}$) on the
                        $y$-axis. This line
                        is referred to as the standard deviation line (or <em>SD Line</em> for short).

                    <p>But this is a pretty rough measure. Remember that standard deviation is the average
                        deviation
                        from the mean and is calculated independently from the other variable. By combining the
                        two
                        standard deviations in a slope we only get a very general sense of the joint behavior of
                        the
                        two variables.
                    </p>
                    <p>Additionally, the direction of the line is missing. In the plot above I have identified a
                        positive correlation with a view to the scatter plot and drawn SD Line accordingly. But
                        If
                        the actual line was downward-sloping, the ratio $\frac{s_y}{s_x}$ would still be
                        positive,
                        as the standard deviations are always positive. In any way, we would like to have
                        mathematical proof of the correlation and its direction.
                    </p>
                    <p>The correlation coefficient will help us to gain a more detailed understanding of the
                        joint
                        movement of the variables and to quantify the direction of the correlation.

                    <p>
                        Pearson's correlation coefficient is the most widely used measure of correlation, which
                        indicates the linear relationship between two observed phenomena. This coefficient is
                        unitless, allowing the examination of a relationship between values that cannot be
                        expressed
                        in the same units, such as height and weight.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The correlation coefficient, $r$, measures the strength and direction of the linear
                        relationship between two variables. It takes values between $-1$ and $1$, where the sign
                        indicates the direction of the relationship and the number indicates the strength of the
                        association. A positive $r$ value means that as one variable increases, the other also
                        increases, while a negative $r$ value means that as one variable increases, the other
                        decreases.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The limitation to linear relationships means that Pearson's correlation coefficient
                        would be
                        around zero for a random heap of dots (first subplot) as well as for a perfect quadratic
                        relationship (U-shaped subplot). Therefore, a low correlation coefficient should not be
                        mistaken
                        for independence of the variables. To be on the safe side plot your data and make sure
                        it is
                        monotonic (steadily increasing or decreasing), otherwise, the correlation coefficient
                        may not be
                        meaningful.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Another thing to keep in mind is that correlation measures association between
                        variables, but
                        association does not necessarily indicate causation. Correlation can be due to pure
                        coincidence
                        or a third, hidden factor (also known as a confounder) that independently affects the
                        observed
                        variables.
                    </p>

                    <p>Let's have a look at the formula of Pearson's correlation coefficient to understand what it does.
                        In both the numerator and denominator we calculate the deviations from the mean. The denominator
                        looks crowded but you can safely disregard it as the standardizing factor.<br />
                        $$r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i -
                        \bar{x})^{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^{2}}} $$<br />
                        The interesting part is happening in the numerator. Let's say we have an observation ($x_{i},
                        y_i$) that is to the right ($x_i&gt;\bar{x}$) and above the point of averages
                        ($y_i&gt;\bar{y}$). </p>
                    <p>For this observation, we would multiply two positive values $(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$
                        yielding once again a positive value. Now take an observation to the left ($x_i&lt;\bar{x}$) and
                        below ($y_i&lt;\bar{y}$) the point of averages, both the deviations from the means are negative
                        but due to the negation of the minus sign by multiplication the result of $(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i -
                        \bar{y})$ is positive again. </p>

                    <p>
                        When we have observations in the lower-left and upper-right quadrants, the numerator of
                        our equation is positive. Conversely, when we have observations in the upper-left and
                        lower-right
                        corners, the numerator is negative. The denominator standardizes the squared values in
                        the
                        numerator, which limits the resulting coefficient to a range of values between $-1$ and
                        $1$.
                        Imagine you have about the same number of observations sitting in positive and negative
                        quadrants in the plot below, their effect would cancel out and the correlation
                        coefficient
                        amounts to approximately zero. This is why Pearson's correlation coefficient only works
                        with
                        linear relationships.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Perhaps you can now see why a positive correlation coefficient is obtained when the
                        majority
                        of observations are clustered in the lower-left and upper-right corners, while a
                        negative
                        coefficient is obtained for observations in the upper-left and lower-right areas.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The correlation coefficients formula can also be written as:$$r=\frac{s_{x y}}{s_xs_{y}}
                        $$where $s_{x y}=\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$ is the
                        <em>sample covariance</em> which measures the joint variability of $x$ and $y$ while
                        $s_x$
                        and
                        $s_{y}$ are the respective standard deviations that normalize the covariance. The
                        correlation
                        coefficient can thus be understood as a normalized version of the covariance.

                    <p>The abovementioned qualities of Pearson's coefficient have interesting implications.
                        Firstly, the
                        relative nature of the coefficient enables comparison between datasets of varying
                        scales.
                        Secondly, it provides the direction of the relationship with mathematical proof.
                        Finally, the
                        value of $r$ provides detailed information about the joint behavior of the two
                        variables. The
                        slope of ($\frac{s_y}{s_{x}}$) only contains insufficient info on joint behavior. But by
                        adjusting the slope of the SD Line with the correlation coefficient we obtain the proper
                        slope
                        of the regression line.<br />
                        $$r*\frac{s_y}{s_{x}}$$<br />
                        A line with this adjusted slope does only change by a certain percentage of the
                        'typical'
                        deviations from the point of averages. The sign tells us if the variables move in the
                        same
                        direction (upward-sloping, positive sign) or in opposing directions (downward-sloping,
                        negative
                        sign). Combining the slope of the SD Line and the correlation coefficient is called the
                        regression method in contrast to the more common method of arriving at a regression
                        parameter
                        namely the method of least squares.

                    <h2 id="OLS">Method of Least Squares</h2>
                    <p>It is common to express the regression line using the following formula:<br />
                        $$\hat{y}=\hat\beta_0+\hat\beta_{1}x+\epsilon$$<br />
                        To draw this line, we start from the intercept $\hat\beta_0$ &mdash; the point where the line
                        crosses
                        the $y$-axis &mdash; and then extend the line by moving along the slope of $\hat\beta_1$ for
                        every
                        increment of $x$. Here, the slope $\hat\beta_1$ is the same as the one from the
                        regression
                        method but now derived through the method of least squares.</p>
                    <p>The symbols' hats above signify that they are estimates. The function's right-hand side
                        consists
                        of two estimates ($\hat\beta_0, \hat\beta_{1}$), and thus, the outcome $\hat{y}$ is also
                        an
                        estimator for the observed value of $y$. We can evaluate our estimates by measuring how
                        far they
                        deviate from the actual values. The epsilon ($\epsilon$) in the formula represents the
                        combined
                        deviation of our estimates from the actual values. The so-called error term $\epsilon$
                        can be
                        understood as the impact of all unaccounted factors in the regression model.
                    </p>
                    <p>For one specific estimate we calculate the individual error $\epsilon_i$ as the
                        discrepancy
                        between the predicted value $\hat{y_i}$ and its actual observed value $y_i$ as:<br />
                        $$(y_{i} - \hat{y_i}) = \left[y_{i} - (\hat\beta_0+\hat\beta_{1}x_i)\right]$$
                        If you're attempting to fit a straight line to the data, the errors (of prediction) are
                        the vertical
                        distances between the observed and estimated values. In other words, they are the
                        distances between
                        the dots and the line in the plot below.</p>

                    </figure>

                    <p>The general idea behind the method of least squares is to minimize the overall errors
                        between estimates and observations. Therefore the sum of the squared errors (SSE) is minimized.

                        $$min\left\{\sum[y_i-(\hat\beta_0+\hat\beta_{1}x_i)]^2\right\}$$

                    <p>Taking the squared errors has two benefits. First of all if we minimize the sum of
                        un-squared errors we might find multiple minima, but it can be shown that there is one (and only
                        one) line for which the SSE is a minimum. More specifically it transforms the minimization
                        problem
                        into a convex optimization problem, allowing for the use of derivatives to determine optimal
                        parameters. Secondly squaring errors accentuates larger deviations, this can potentially
                        prevent overfitting but also lead to over-simplification (generalization versus overfitting).
                    </p>
                    <p>By optimizing the above function we find the quantities of $\hat\beta_0$ and
                        $\hat\beta_{1}$ that
                        yield the least square error. </p>
                    <p>In math it looks like this:<br />
                        $$\text{Find }\min_{\beta_{0}, \,\beta_1} Q(\beta_{0}, \,\beta_1), \quad\quad \text{for
                        }
                        Q(\beta_{0},\,\beta_1) = \sum (y_i - (\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i))^2$$
                        $$\frac{\partial Q(\beta_{0}, \beta_1)}{\beta_{0}}\quad \rightarrow \quad
                        \hat\beta_{0}=\bar{y}-\hat{\beta_1}\bar{x}$$
                        $$\frac{\partial Q(\beta_{0}, \beta_1)}{\beta_{1}}\quad \rightarrow \quad \hat{\beta_1}=
                        \frac{\sum
                        (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^{2}} = \frac{s_{x y}}{s_x^2}$$
                        <br />
                    <p> They are called the least squares estimates of the population parameters $\beta_0$ and
                        $\beta_1$,
                        and the prediction equation $\hat{y}=\hat\beta_0+\hat\beta_{1}x+\epsilon$ is called the
                        least
                        squares line.</p>
                    <p> I have said before that this slope of $\hat\beta_1$ is the same as the one worked out by
                        combining the slope of the SD Line and the correlation coefficient. Here is how they're
                        connected in symbols:<br />
                        $$\hat\beta_1=r \frac{s_y}{s_{x}}=\frac{s_{x y}}{s_{x}\thinspace
                        s_{y}}\,\frac{s_y}{s_{x}} =\frac{s_{x y}}{s_{x}^2}$$<br />
                        where $r$ is the correlation coefficient, $s_x$ and $s_y$ are the sample standard
                        deviations,
                        $s_{xy}$ the sample covariance and $s_x$ is the sample variance of $x$. </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>Let's see how we find the intercept $\hat\beta_0$. <br />
                        $$\hat\beta_{0}=\bar{y}-\hat{\beta_1}\bar{x}$$<br />
                        It's pretty straightforward, once we have the slope of the regression line we can walk from the
                        point of averages ($\bar x, \, \bar y$) along the regression line towards the point where it
                        intersects with the $y$-axis ($x=0$) this is our intercept $\hat\beta_0$.
